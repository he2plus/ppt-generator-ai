###Human: Generate 5 slides on the topic 'Classification'. Each slide should have a slide number:, a heading: and content:. ###Assistant:


Slide 1: 
Slide Number: 1 
Heading: Introduction to Classification 
Content: Classification is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm used to predict a categorical label. It is used to assign a given input data to one of a given set of classes. 

Slide 2: 
Slide Number: 2 
Heading: Types of Classification 
Content: There are two main types of classification algorithms: binary classification and multi-class classification. Binary classification is used to classify data into two classes, while multi-class classification is used to classify data into more than two classes. 

Slide 3: 
Slide Number: 3 
Heading: Classification Algorithms 
Content: Common classification algorithms include logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, naive Bayes, and k-nearest neighbors. 

Slide 4: 
Slide Number: 4 
Heading: Evaluation Metrics 
Content: Common evaluation metrics used to evaluate the performance of a classification algorithm include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. 

Slide 5: 
Slide Number: 5 
Heading: Applications of Classification 
Content: Classification algorithms are used in a variety of applications, such as spam filtering, image recognition, medical diagnosis, and credit scoring.
