Slide 2: 
Heading: NLP Applications
Content: NLP is used in a variety of applications, such as text classification, sentiment analysis, machine translation, question answering, and text summarization.

Slide 3: 
Heading: NLP Techniques
Content: NLP techniques include tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, parsing, semantic analysis, and sentiment analysis.

Slide 4: 
Heading: Tokenization
Content: Tokenization is the process of breaking a sentence into individual words or phrases.

Slide 5: 
Heading: Part-of-Speech Tagging
Content: Part-of-speech tagging is the process of assigning a part-of-speech (e.g. noun, verb, adjective, etc.) to each word in a sentence.

Slide 6: 
Heading: Parsing
Content: Parsing is the process of analyzing a sentence to determine its syntactic structure.

Slide 7: 
Heading: Semantic Analysis
