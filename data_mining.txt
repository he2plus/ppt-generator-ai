Slide 3: 
Heading: Association 
Content: Association is a data mining technique that discovers relationships between variables in large datasets.

Slide 4: 
Heading: Classification 
Content: Classification is a data mining technique that assigns items in a dataset to target categories or classes.

Slide 5: 
Heading: Clustering 
Content: Clustering is a data mining technique that groups items in a dataset into meaningful subgroups or clusters.

Slide 6: 
Heading: Prediction 
Content: Prediction is a data mining technique that uses known values to predict unknown values.

Slide 7: 
Heading: Outlier Detection 
Content: Outlier detection is a data mining technique that identifies items in a dataset that are significantly different from the rest of the data.
