###Human: Generate 8 slides on the topic 'Feature Engineering'. Each slide should have a slide number:, a heading: and content:. ###Assistant:


Slide 1: 
Heading: Introduction 
Content: Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into features that better represent the underlying problem to the predictive models, resulting in improved model accuracy on unseen data.

Slide 2: 
Heading: Feature Selection 
Content: Feature selection is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features for use in model construction. It is a crucial step in the process of building a machine learning model.

Slide 3: 
Heading: Feature Extraction 
Content: Feature extraction is the process of transforming raw data into features that better represent the underlying problem to the predictive models. It is a process of dimensionality reduction or data compression.

Slide 4: 
Heading: Feature Transformation 
Content: Feature transformation is the process of transforming existing features into new features that better represent the underlying problem to the predictive models. It is a process of data transformation.

Slide 5: 
Heading: Feature Creation 
Content: Feature creation is the process of creating new features from existing features. It is a process of feature engineering.

Slide 6: 
Heading: Feature Scaling 
Content: Feature scaling is the process of transforming features by scaling each feature to a given range. It is a process of normalization.

Slide 7: 
Heading: Feature Encoding 
Content: Feature encoding is the process of transforming categorical features into numerical features. It is a process of data encoding.

Slide 8: 
Heading: Conclusion 
Content: Feature engineering is an essential step in the process of building a machine learning model. It involves feature selection, extraction, transformation, creation, scaling, and encoding.
