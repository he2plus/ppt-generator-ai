PPTgeneration is done in MSPowerPoint fromscratch. On any idea, a person has to start
 from a blank slide and put their ideas together in the form of text or images depending
 on the topic they are presenting. It’s a hassle to make presentations from scratch. With
 the advancement of technology, there should be ease for everyone. Artificial Intelligence
 has grown into a useful tool in recent years allowing computers to think and act like
 humans. AI research is ongoing and expanding in today’s world. We can now generate
 visually appealing and informative PPT slides using AI-based techniques. These involve
 Pre-trained models of text and image generation, also the Python built-in libraries. Our
 product is summed up on Falcon 7b (Fine-tuned), Stable Diffusion, and Python pptx
 library. PPTs will have images and text related to the topic that will reduce the time of
 the user and it will give him PPT containing innovative ideas on his topic which he can
 edit later on.
